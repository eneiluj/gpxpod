Application to display gpx, kml, igc, fit and tcx files collections,
view elevation profiles and tracks stats, filter tracks,
 color tracks by speed, elevation or pace and compare divergent parts of similar tracks.

üåç Help us to translate this app on [GpxPod Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/gpxpod).

GpxPod :

* üó∫ can display gpx/kml/tcx/igc/fit files anywhere in your storage. .fit files will be converted and displayed only if **GpsBabel** is found on the server system.
* üìè supports metric, english and nautical measure systems
* üìà  draws elevation, speed or pace interactive chart
* üñº  displays geotagged pictures found in selected directory
* generates public links pointing to a track/folder. This link can be used if the file/folder is shared by public link
* can correct tracks elevations if SRTM.py (gpxelevations) is found on the server's system
* ‚öñ  can make global comparison of multiple tracks
* ‚öñ  can make visual pair comparison of divergent parts of similar tracks
* proudly uses MaplibreGL and Maptiler
* adds possibility to view .gpx files directly from the "Files" app

This app is tested under Nextcloud 16 with Firefox and Chromium.
